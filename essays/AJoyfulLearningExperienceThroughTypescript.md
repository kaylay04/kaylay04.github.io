**A Joyful Learning Experience Through Typescript
I have been enjoying using Typescript so far in this course, as someone who is completely new to it. 
Additionally, I have already learned so much about it just from the short time that we have spent learning about it.
It is similar to Java, which I spent two semesters learning about.
From what I have learned so far, I like using Typescript more since it feels more straightforward and easier to use than Java.  

I believe that Typescript is a good programming language because it enhances Javascript by adding static typing. 
This allows for code to be easier to maintain, which is useful in large-scale projects, and improves the code’s readability.
Additionally, Typescript is able to work with any existing Javascript code, allowing for the two types of code to be used.
However, the only downside to Typescript is that it seems like it could be a difficult coding language to learn at the start since there can be so many complexities within it.

Using athletic software engineering for WODS allows for a more immersive and impactful learning experience for me.
The practice WODs are useful because they require me to think quickly and reinforce the coding concepts that I am learning.
This style of learning seems to effectively simulate real-world coding scenarios where time and accuracy are vital and having these WODs helps me to prepare for when I have those scenarios.

Personally, I have mixed feelings about the WODs and practices of athletic software engineering.
On the positive side, I think it will help me to become a stronger coder and a quick thinker, and will help me in the future in interviews.
Conversely, it can be stressful due to those time constraints and the pressure to perform well in each WOD.
Ultimately, I think that this style of learning will work for me since it will push me to get better at athletic software engineering and better understand the concepts that we are learning.
