My journey in software engineering comes from my passion for cybersecurity. 
Despite thinking that building efficient and scalable systems is fascinating, my true interest lies in protecting these systems from potential threats.
In today's world where cyberattacks and data breaches occur often, the role of cybersecurity in software engineering is becoming more important.
Learning about software engineering and cybersecurity allows me to ensure that these systems are fortified against potential vulnerabilities.

Going into the future, I am eager to specialize in penetration testing, cryptography, digital forensics, and secure coding practices.
Understanding how to identify and mitigate security risks during the development process is vital for creating software that can hold against cyberattacks. 
By improving these skills, I aim to contribute to the development of applications that are functional and resilient against cyber threats.

Furthermore, I am interested in the integration of cybersecurity with emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing.
These fields have unique security challenges and by learning about them now, I will be able to design solutions that are secure and innovative.
My goal in the future is to become a versatile software engineer with a focus on cybersecurity and ensuring that the systems we have today will be safe for the future.
