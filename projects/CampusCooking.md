## Overview

Campus Cooking is an application that helps campus students make affordable, healthy, and accessible meals. It provides students with recipes that respect common constraints such as limited kitchen resources, limited cooking skills, limited time, and limited access to grocery stores.

### Key Features

### Milestone 2

For Milestone 2, we will significantly enhance our system's functionality and quality by implementing at least four fully functional pages, including database integration for reading and writing data. We will gaian use GitHub Issues and a "M2" project board. 

You can watch our Milestone 2 project board [here](https://github.com/orgs/Campus-Cooking/projects/5/views/6).

For Milestone 2 we have implemented these pages in our system:
* Home Page
* Log in and Sign up Page
* View Recipe Page
* Add Recipe Page (only accessible for logged in users)
* Contact Page


### Milestone 3 

The purpose of Milestone 3 is to polish the codebase, address any remaining UI issues, and ensure a smooth user experience. This final pass involved debugging, enhancing styling, and improving overall functionality.

## Community Feedback

Users appreciate the clean, modern design and student-friendly approach, highlighting the focus on simple recipes that use basic kitchen appliances like microwaves and toaster ovens. Features like dietary filters, estimated costs, serving sizes, and step-by-step instructions make cooking approachable and affordable for students with limited time and resources.

Users would like to see new features added in the future, like a "quick meals" or "5-ingredient recipes" section, difficulty ratings, nutritional information, and a way to save or favorite recipes. Adding community-driven elements like comments, reviews, and ratings could enhance engagement, while streamlined recipe submission and consistency in page layouts would improve usability.

Overall, the feedback suggests that the site effectively solves a major problem for students by making cooking accessible and affordable. While thereâ€™s room for added functionality and community-building features, the core concept resonates well, making it a valuable resource for those new to cooking.
